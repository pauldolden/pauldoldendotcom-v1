summary: Wherin I equate my journey of learning to code to something else.

Back when I used to write more often, about more abstract and less interesting things, I never used to worry about feeling like I deserved a spot in the conversation, I just started saying stuff. Seldom did people actually listen, but at least I did the talking. When it comes to writing about code though, well... imposter syndrome is a very much a real thing and thoughts like "who cares what I think, I've only been doing this for 5 minutes" take precedence over anything else I could ever want to say. The fact is though, I am a professional. People do put steadily increasing amounts of money in my bank account for doing this stuff, so I figure maybe, just maybe, I'll permit myself to sneak a couple of quick one liners into the chat, and hope for a few laughs or at worst a couple of pitty nods.

The above being said though, and irrespective of any neurotic self doubt about writing about code, I do remain acceptably confident in my ability to write the code itself, and when I allow myself to stop for a few seconds to think about how that actually happened, the journey forms in my mind in a bunch of vague images which, if you'll allow me, I'll attempt to distill into an comprehensible narrative.

There is a whole bunch of reasons why I want to do this. Here's a few:

1. I think looking back on where I started, might help me chop a couple of limbs off of this black knight that is my self doubt.
2. My path wasn't exactly a straight one, and much of it I don't entirely remember, and I'd like to try to.
3. When I was starting, all I did was look for examples of people who hadn't failed, and the more of those stories that exist, the better.
4. People on podcasts tell me I should. [^1]

So... Here... We... Go...

Before I dive in in earnest, a small piece of background about why I started to learn to code in the first place, because despite being a career that I believe I'm actually quite suited to, it was, frustratingly, never on my radar.

I was 27 when I wrote my first line of code, and my introduction to it was largely out of necessity. The agency who'd been hired to build my family's company's new website had been floundering for two years, had over-promised and massively under-delivered. This uncertainty had started to put a financial strain on the business, and alternative plans needed to be made.

Cue a chorus of _"How hard can it be to learn this stuff?"_.

The answer, of course, was pretty bloody hard.

I did, however, find myself immediately swept up by the sense of frustrating fulfillment that comes with making things work, and my desire to learn became a bit of an obsession.

The (rather strange) old saying goes "there's more than one way to skin a cat", and it's a very apt one for describing the process of learning to code. I, however, think of the venture in slightly different and far less gruesome terms.

I've done a fair amount of reflecting on my personal journey and I think it could best be described as venturing through a endless stretch of wilderness.
